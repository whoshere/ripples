Ripples
=======

This is a demo of a classic water refraction effect:     
You're viewing an image    
which is resting below  
a rippling water pool.

To run the demo go to <https://whoshere.github.io/ripples>.  

When the demo starts, a prompt will ask you to choose one of two images.  
Choose one, and the magic starts.  
Create ripples on the screen by moving your fingers in a swirly way.  
No touchscreen?  No problem, use your mouse instead. 

Besides the two preselected images,  
you can ripple any image you like:   
just press the 'choose your own' button on the menu.

To navigate back to the  menu from a ripple page,  
press the back button on the browser,    
or press the back arrow at the bottom of the page.  


The javascript code for this ripples filter was written by Sergey Chikuyonok, based on Neil Wallis's java code.   
The original code was written much earlier by someone else (i don't know who).
