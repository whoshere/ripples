Ripples
=======

This is a demo of a classic water refraction effect:     
You're viewing an image    
resting below  
a rippling water pool.

To run the demo go to <https://whoshere.github.io/ripples>

When the demo starts, a prompt will ask you to choose one of two 
images.  Choose either one, and the magic starts. Create ripples 
on the screen by moving your fingers in a swirly way. 
(This version only works on a touch screen.)

The javascript code for the demo was written by Sergey Chikuyonok, 
based on Neil Wallis's java code. The original code was written 
much earlier by someone else (i don't know who).
