Ripples
=======

This is a demo of a classic water refraction effect:     
You're viewing an image    
which is resting below  
a rippling water pool.

To run the demo go to <https://whoshere.github.io/ripples>

When the demo starts, a prompt will ask you to choose one of two images.  
Choose one, and the magic starts.  
Create ripples on the screen by moving your fingers in a swirly way.  
(No touchscreen?  No problem, use your mouse instead.)  

To select the other image,   
press  'return to menu' at the bottom of the page    
and begin anew.

The javascript code for the demo was written by Sergey Chikuyonok, based on Neil Wallis's java code.   
The original code was written much earlier by someone else (i don't know who).
